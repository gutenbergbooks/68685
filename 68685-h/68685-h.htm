<h2 class="nobreak">OUR LADY OF RED LIPS</h2>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> place was Paris.</p>

<p>A man stood in front of an art-dealer’s
window, and looked at the
painted picture of a woman.</p>

<p>The man was about twenty-five years of
age and extremely handsome.</p>

<p>He was big and brawny.</p>

<p>His hair was brown and curly, and his
eyes were blue and frank.</p>

<p>The woman was about thirty years of age,
and exceedingly beautiful.</p>

<p>She was small and slender.</p>

<p>Her complexion was creamy white, her
hair was inky black, her eyes were dark
green, and her lips were bright red.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>
<p>If you were French, you could tell that
the man was American.</p>

<p>And if you were an American, you could
tell that the woman was French.</p>

<p>The man stood and stared at the picture.</p>

<p>He stared at the white complexion&mdash;but
he had seen complexion like that before.</p>

<p>He stared at the black hair&mdash;but he had
also seen hair like that before.</p>

<p>He stared at the green eyes&mdash;but he had
even seen eyes like that before.</p>

<p>He stared at the red lips&mdash;and he had
never seen lips like that before.</p>

<p>He had never thought of such lips.</p>

<p>He had never dreamed of such lips.</p>

<p>Of course their vivid crimson color was
unnatural, fantastic, grotesque.</p>

<p>The picture must have been designed for
a poster.</p>

<p>But nevertheless it fascinated the man
strangely.</p>

<p>The white face seemed to turn to him.</p>

<p>The green eyes seemed to look at him.</p>

<p>The red lips seemed to smile at him.</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>And then he went into the shop.</p>

<p>“What is that picture?” said the man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>
<p>“That is the portrait of a lady,” said the
proprietor.</p>

<p>“Who painted it?” said the man.</p>

<p>“Paul Gaspard,” said the proprietor.</p>

<p>“Is he well known?” said the man.</p>

<p>“He would have been&mdash;had he lived,”
said the proprietor.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” said the man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the proprietor, “he died six
months ago, under peculiar circumstances.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” said the man.</p>

<p>“He was young, and he was clever, and
he was handsome,” said the proprietor, “men
admired him, and women loved him. The
lady who posed for this portrait was one
of those who loved him. She had loved
other men. She had loved an Italian prince.
But he died. She had loved an English
lord. But he died, also. And then&mdash;she
loved Paul Gaspard.”</p>

<p>“And then he too died!” said the man.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;and he too died!” said the proprietor.</p>

<p>“How did he die?” said the man.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows how&mdash;or why,” said the
proprietor. “He was found dead in his bed
one morning. That was all. There was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>some sort of a wound, or a scar, on his
breast, over his heart. For a time the coroner
was puzzled. At first there was some
thought of suicide&mdash;or even of murder. But,
in the end, the authorities decided that Paul
Gaspard had died from natural causes, and
there the matter ended.”</p>

<p>“And the picture,” said the man.</p>

<p>“The picture had just been finished on the
very day he died,” said the proprietor, “by
a strange coincidence.”</p>

<p>“Very strange indeed!” said the man.</p>

<p>“Paul Gaspard had from time to time
borrowed sums of money from me, until he
owed me in all some fifteen hundred francs,”
said the proprietor, “so when he died, and
left no money, I claimed the picture&mdash;and
I got it.”</p>

<p>“And the lady who posed for it?” said the
man.</p>

<p>“She left Paris as soon as Paul Gaspard
was in his grave,” said the proprietor.</p>

<p>“Where did she go?” said the man.</p>

<p>“To St. Petersburg&mdash;with a Russian
duke,” said the proprietor.</p>

<p>“Is she there now?” said the man.</p>

<p>“No, she is at Monte Carlo,” said the proprietor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>
<p>“With the Russian duke?” said the man.</p>

<p>“No, she is there alone,” said the proprietor.</p>

<p>“Where is the Russian duke?” said the
man.</p>

<p>“He is dead,” said the proprietor.</p>

<p>“Dead?” said the man.</p>

<p>“Yes, dead,” said the proprietor, “as dead
as all the rest of her lovers!”</p>

<p>“The devil!” said the man.</p>

<p>“Quite so!” said the proprietor.</p>

<p>“And the name of this woman,” said the
man, “what is it?”</p>

<p>“She calls herself Elise Du Barry,” said
the proprietor, “but other people call her
something else.”</p>

<p>“What do they call her?” said the man.</p>

<p>“‘Our Lady of Red Lips’!” said the proprietor.</p>

<p>The man thanked the proprietor, and left
the shop.</p>

<p>In the street he stopped before the window
once more, and stood and stared at the
picture.</p>

<p>“‘Our Lady of Red Lips’,” muttered the
man.</p>

<p>And, as he left the window, and walked
away, he murmured, “Monte Carlo!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>
<p>That night the man dreamed a strange
and startling dream.</p>

<p>First he dreamed of black hair.</p>

<p>Hair as black as night.</p>

<p>It covered the heavens and the earth.
There was nothing else in the world but
black hair.</p>

<p>Then he dreamed of white skin.</p>

<p>Skin as white as snow.</p>

<p>It covered the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>There was nothing else in the world but
white skin.</p>

<p>Then he dreamed of green eyes.</p>

<p>Eyes as green as the sea.</p>

<p>They covered the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>There was nothing else in the world but
green eyes.</p>

<p>Then he dreamed of red lips.</p>

<p>Lips as red as blood.</p>

<p>They covered the heavens and the earth.</p>

<p>There was nothing else in the world but
red lips.</p>

<p>The lips kissed him on the brow.</p>

<p>He felt as though he were swooning.</p>

<p>The lips kissed him on the mouth.</p>

<p>He felt as though he were dying.</p>

<p>The lips kissed him on the heart.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>
<p>He felt as though the world were coming
to an end.</p>

<p>His soul was full of terror.</p>

<p>He uttered a shriek.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;he awoke.</p>

<p>The next day the man left Paris.</p>

<p>He went to Monte Carlo.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The man’s name was Howard Leslie.</p>

<p>He was a New Yorker.</p>

<p>He was an only son, and his father was a
millionaire.</p>

<p>This was his first visit to Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>He walked into the Casino.</p>

<p>He looked at the people.</p>

<p>They were strange to see.</p>

<p>And the people looked at him.</p>

<p>He was good to behold.</p>

<p>The celebrated habitues of the place passed
before him.</p>

<p>He saw Madame de Lara, the Italian
singer.</p>

<p>And La Belle Bolero, the Spanish dancer.</p>

<p>Yvonne Yvette, the French model.</p>

<p>And Olga Maronoff, the Russian poetess.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>
<p>And then&mdash;with a bound of the heart, and
a gasp of the breath&mdash;he saw <i>her</i>!</p>

<p>Elise Du Barry&mdash;Our Lady of Red
Lips!...</p>

<p>She wore a white satin evening gown.</p>

<p>There were big pearls in her hair, around
her throat, and on her fingers.</p>

<p>Her complexion was as white as her
gown.</p>

<p>Not a touch of color, in her dress, or in
her face&mdash;except her mouth.</p>

<p>But, just as the setting sun will dominate
an evening sky, so did this crimson mouth
dominate this ashen face, and this pallid
figure. One was conscious of the woman’s
mouth, first, last, and all the time.</p>

<p>One could not help but be conscious of
it.</p>

<p>Howard Leslie stood and stared at her.</p>

<p>And she paused and glanced at him.</p>

<p>How like she was to her portrait!</p>

<p>Or rather, how like her portrait was to
her!</p>

<p>At last the white face did in reality turn
to him!</p>

<p>At last the green eyes did in reality look
at him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>At last the red lips did in reality smile
at him!</p>

<p>And then Elise Du Barry passed by.</p>

<p>Howard Leslie followed her.</p>

<p>She sat at one of the tables.</p>

<p>He stood beside her.</p>

<p>She put down some gold&mdash;on the red.</p>

<p>She lost.</p>

<p>He put down some gold&mdash;on the black.</p>

<p>He won.</p>

<p>She looked up at him.</p>

<p>He looked down at her.</p>

<p>Their eyes met&mdash;his so frank and blue,
and hers so strange and green.</p>

<p>He spoke to her.</p>

<p>She answered him.</p>

<p>He didn’t know what he was saying to
her.</p>

<p>He didn’t know what she was saying to
him.</p>

<p>He only knew that he and she were talking
together.</p>

<p>He only knew that he and she were walking
together&mdash;out of the Casino....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One month passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>And then, one day, all Monte Carlo, all
Europe, and in fact all the world, was surprised
and shocked to learn that Elise Du
Barry, a celebrated French beauty, had
been strangled at Monte Carlo, and that the
man in whose company she had been much
seen of late, Howard Leslie, a young
American millionaire, had become a raving
maniac. The madman, in his paroxysms,
constantly clutched his breast, where there
was some sort of a wound, or a scar, and
he continually cried,</p>

<p>“Heart’s blood! Heart’s blood! Heart’s
blood!”</p>

<p>The throat of Elise Du Barry had been
dreadfully disfigured by the strong hands
that had crushed the life out of her, but
her mouth was still a bright crimson color,
thus entitling the woman, even in death, to
the name by which she had been popularly
known in life&mdash;that of “Our Lady of Red
Lips.”...</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PAULA_LOVED_PEARLS">PAULA LOVED PEARLS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>aula</span> didn’t care for diamonds.</p>

<p>Or rubies.</p>

<p>Or emeralds.</p>

<p>She only cared for pearls.</p>

<p>And her feeling was more than mere admiration.</p>

<p>It was&mdash;love.</p>

<p>Passionate love.</p>

<p>But she could not afford to have pearls
<i>to wear</i>.</p>

<p>So she had to be content to have pearls
<i>to look at</i>.</p>

<p>She used to stand in front of the jewellers’
windows where there were pearls displayed.</p>

<p>The rings delighted her.</p>

<p>The brooches bewildered her.</p>

<p>But the necklaces distracted her.</p>

<p>She used to gaze at them.</p>

<p>She used to gloat over them.</p>

<p>And then she would go home&mdash;relieved.</p>

<p>But not satisfied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>
<p>In her bedroom Paula had pictures on the
walls.</p>

<p>Many were studies of women wearing
pearls.</p>

<p>Empresses and actresses.</p>

<p>In her bedroom Paula had books on the
tables.</p>

<p>Many were volumes treating of pearls.</p>

<p>Their formation and their history.</p>

<p>Often Paula would go to sleep at night
reading one of these books.</p>

<p>Or looking at one of these pictures.</p>

<p>Then she would dream that she had pearls
of her own.</p>

<p>Plenty of them.</p>

<p>And she would be happy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So you see that Paula had a mania.</p>

<p>But she also had a husband.</p>

<p>Her husband didn’t have any money.</p>

<p>But he had a position.</p>

<p>A position with an exporting concern.</p>

<p>This concern did business in the Far
East.</p>

<p>So a time came when Paula’s husband was
sent to the Orient.</p>

<p>And when Paula’s husband went there&mdash;he
took Paula with him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>
<p>They went to Japan.</p>

<p>And to China.</p>

<p>And to India.</p>

<p>In India Paula saw strange things.</p>

<p>She saw the Hindoos bathing in the sacred
Ganges.</p>

<p>She saw the Parsees exposing their dead
to the vultures.</p>

<p>And she saw fakirs making mango trees
grow out of seeds before one’s very eyes.</p>

<p>And in India Paula heard strange things,
too.</p>

<p>She heard of strange lives.</p>

<p>And of strange deaths.</p>

<p>And she heard of the Rajah of Raboda
who owned the finest pearls in the world.</p>

<p>He was said to have pearl necklaces yards
long.</p>

<p>And pearl pendants the size of walnuts.</p>

<p>And he was said to be willing and glad
to display these treasures to any visitors
who cared to journey to his palace in the
hills to see them.</p>

<p>Paula told her husband of these things.</p>

<p>He was not interested.</p>

<p>Paula asked her husband to take her to
Raboda.</p>

<p>He declined.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>
<p>Paula asked her husband if she might go
there alone.</p>

<p>He consented.</p>

<p>So Paula got a letter of introduction from
the Consul.</p>

<p>And she started for the hills.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paula arrived at the Palace.</p>

<p>She presented her credentials.</p>

<p>And she was informed that she might see
the pearls.</p>

<p>An attendant escorted her through corridors
and courts, into an apartment where,
in a glass case under iron bars, were displayed
the objects that Paula loved.</p>

<p>Loved with all her heart.</p>

<p>And with all her soul....</p>

<p>Paula stood there transfixed with ecstasy.</p>

<p>She stood there&mdash;she knew not how long.</p>

<p>And then she became conscious that someone
was standing beside her.</p>

<p>Someone was watching her.</p>

<p>Paula looked up.</p>

<p>She found herself facing a tall man wearing
a green satin robe and a lavender silk
turban.</p>

<p>Around his neck was a string of pearls.</p>

<p>In his turban was a clasp of pearls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>
<p>And in his eyes&mdash;was a strange expression....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“I am the Rajah of Raboda,” said the
man.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said the woman.</p>

<p>“These pearls are mine,” said the man.</p>

<p>“They are marvellous!” said the woman.</p>

<p>“You like pearls?” said the man.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;love&mdash;them!” said the woman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It really was a strange thing that Paula
had not made a more advantageous marriage
than she had done.</p>

<p>Her husband was not of much account.</p>

<p>And Paula was&mdash;quite a beauty.</p>

<p>Her complexion was dark.</p>

<p>Her hair was black and glossy.</p>

<p>Her eyes were black and fiery.</p>

<p>And her lips were full and red.</p>

<p>She was just the type to appeal to an
American millionaire.</p>

<p>Or&mdash;to an Indian Prince.</p>

<p>But Paula had never met an American
millionaire.</p>

<p>And she had never met an Indian Prince&mdash;before....</p>

<p>She looked at the face of the Rajah.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>
<p>His skin was black.</p>

<p>But his hair and his eyes were no blacker
than her own.</p>

<p>If she only looked into his eyes, he might
have been a mate for her.</p>

<p>If he only looked into her eyes she might
have been a mate for him.</p>

<p>And now he <i>did</i> look into her eyes.</p>

<p>And now she <i>did</i> look into his....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paula loved pearls.</p>

<p>And the Rajah loved&mdash;women.</p>

<p>The Rajah <i>had</i> pearls.</p>

<p>And Paula <i>was</i>&mdash;a woman.</p>

<p>So they stood side by side.</p>

<p>And they stared at one another.</p>

<p>Then the Rajah showed Paula more
pearls.</p>

<p>He conducted her about the palace.</p>

<p>He offered her some refreshments.</p>

<p>And he invited her to be his guest over
night.</p>

<p>Paula accepted his attentions.</p>

<p>And his invitation.</p>

<p>She wondered if she were asleep.</p>

<p>And if this were a dream.</p>

<p>One of those marvellous dreams of hers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<p>She had imagined it all so often before.</p>

<p>But no, this was not a vision!</p>

<p>It was a reality!</p>

<p>She was the guest of an Indian Prince.</p>

<p>The Prince had the finest pearls in the
world.</p>

<p>And he&mdash;liked her.</p>

<p>She appealed to him.</p>

<p>So Paula&mdash;thought, and thought, and
thought....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night the Rajah put on even more
gorgeous robes than he had worn during the
day.</p>

<p>And even more splendid pearls.</p>

<p>Paula forgot to look at his black face.</p>

<p>She forgot to think of it.</p>

<p>She only looked at his white pearls.</p>

<p>She couldn’t think of anything else.</p>

<p>The Rajah told Paula of how his ancestors
had obtained these pearls from afar.</p>

<p>How they had sought for them.</p>

<p>How they had fought for them.</p>

<p><i>This</i> one had been in the eye of a Buddha.</p>

<p><i>That</i> one had been the cause of a battle.</p>

<p>And so on, and on, and on....</p>

<p>Then he stopped speaking of&mdash;pearls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>
<p>And he started speaking of&mdash;her.</p>

<p>His voice softened.</p>

<p>His eyes brightened</p>

<p>And at last&mdash;he said it.</p>

<p>He was a prince.</p>

<p>He possessed pearls.</p>

<p>He&mdash;loved&mdash;her!....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What did it matter?</p>

<p>Where was the harm?</p>

<p>What was a&mdash;husband?</p>

<p>What was&mdash;anything?</p>

<p>The Rajah held her hand in his.</p>

<p>There were pearls in the rings on his
fingers.</p>

<p>The Rajah put his arm around her
waist.</p>

<p>There were pearls in the bracelets on his
wrists.</p>

<p>The Rajah crushed her to his breast.</p>

<p>There were pearls in the chains around
his neck....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Paula returned to her husband.</p>

<p>She wore a string of pearls around her
throat.</p>

<p>She gave her husband an explanation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>
<p>She said that she had bought the pearls
in a shop.</p>

<p>She told him that they were imitation.</p>

<p>And he believed her.</p>

<p>And she despised him for it.</p>

<p>Poor fool!</p>

<p>He didn’t know the value of pearls.</p>

<p>But the Rajah of Raboda did.</p>

<p>And so did Paula!...</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> Place was the Harem.</p>

<p>The Time was the Morning.</p>

<p>And the Occasion was the Toilet.</p>

<p>The wives and the women of the Maharajah
were being made beautiful for the
pleasure of their lord and master.</p>

<p>Their bodies were bathed in the pool.</p>

<p>And anointed with oils.</p>

<p>And burnished with buffers.</p>

<p>With infinite care and patience, blue veins
were traced on their limbs, and red tips were
painted on their breasts.</p>

<p>Their raven locks were scented, and their
dusky cheeks were tinted.</p>

<p>Their eyes were darkened with kohl, and
their mouths were brightened with carmine.</p>

<p>The nails of their fingers and of their toes
were stained a ruddy hue.</p>

<p>But none of the wives or the women demanded
or received more care or attention
than did Lotus Flower, the favorite dancing
girl of the Maharajah.</p>

<p>For none was so lithe of limb nor so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>supple of joint as was this same Lotus
Flower.</p>

<p>She it was who could sway the slowest.</p>

<p>And she it was who could whirl the
fastest.</p>

<p>Lotus Flower was a young Circassian
beauty.</p>

<p>She had been brought from Bagdad.</p>

<p>For two days the Maharajah had had in
the palace as his guest an English officer,
one Captain Esme Lawrence.</p>

<p>And for two nights Lotus Flower had
been summoned to the Court of Delight to
dance before the visitor.</p>

<p>The first night Lotus Flower had performed
the Dance of the Flames.</p>

<p>She had pirouetted in and out among
lighted candles.</p>

<p>The English officer had watched her intently.</p>

<p>The second night Lotus Flower had performed
the Dance of the Sword.</p>

<p>During her gyrations she had borne a
scimitar upon her head.</p>

<p>Again the English officer had watched
her intently.</p>

<p>To-night Lotus Flower was to perform
the Dance of the Cobra.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>
<p>And to-morrow morning the English officer
was to go away.</p>

<p>Lotus Flower must do credit to the Maharajah.</p>

<p>And to herself.</p>

<p>She did not need to be told so.</p>

<p>She understood it fully.</p>

<p>So she devoted the entire morning to the
beautifying of her body.</p>

<p>And she devoted the entire afternoon to
the selecting of her adornments.</p>

<p>The English officer had watched her
hands.</p>

<p>So she put jingling bracelets around her
wrists.</p>

<p>The English officer had watched her feet.</p>

<p>So she put jangling bangles around her
ankles.</p>

<p>The English officer had watched her
body.</p>

<p>So she swathed herself in gleaming gauze.</p>

<p>And the English officer had watched her
face.</p>

<p>So she painted, perfumed and powdered
until even the other dancing girls admitted
among themselves that Lotus Flower had
never looked lovelier.</p>

<p>But still Lotus Flower was not satisfied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>
<p>The English officer had watched her eyes.</p>

<p>So she put cosmetics around them to make
them darker.</p>

<p>And she put cosmetics into them to make
them brighter.</p>

<p>But that was not why he had watched her.</p>

<p>That was not <i>how</i> he had watched her.</p>

<p>He had looked beyond the blackness of
cosmetics.</p>

<p>He had looked beyond the whiteness of
cosmetics.</p>

<p>He had looked in, in, in&mdash;to her soul.</p>

<p>And her soul had looked out, out, out&mdash;to
him.</p>

<p>Lotus Flower realized that she did not
need kohl and carmine with which to charm
the English officer.</p>

<p>And this knowledge made her glad.</p>

<p>And this knowledge made her sad, too&mdash;at
the same time.</p>

<p>Do you doubt that such a paradoxical
state of mind could exist?</p>

<p>Out upon you then,&mdash;truly you can know
but little of the ways of woman!...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night a splendid repast was served
in the Great Banquet Hall.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>
<p>Afterwards the Maharajah escorted his
guest to the Court of Delight.</p>

<p>Two throne-like chairs were brought forward
for the two men, the Indian Prince
and the English officer.</p>

<p>The Maharajah wore pantaloons of crimson
silk, a coat of purple velvet embroidered
in gold, and a turban of yellow silk embellished
with an aigrette of diamonds.</p>

<p>Around his neck were strings of pearls.</p>

<p>And on his fingers were enormous rubies.</p>

<p>The Maharajah was an ugly man.</p>

<p>But he looked magnificent.</p>

<p>Captain Lawrence wore the conventional
evening clothes of an English gentleman.</p>

<p>He was a handsome man.</p>

<p>And he looked attractive.</p>

<p>A young boy with a stringed instrument
sang two songs for them.</p>

<p>One was a song of joy.</p>

<p>And one was a song of sorrow.</p>

<p>An old man with a black cloth did some
tricks for them.</p>

<p>First he made various objects appear out
of the cloth.</p>

<p>And then he made various objects disappear
into it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>
<p>Finally, to the beating of tom-toms, and
the lilting of pipes, Lotus Flower was
brought forward for her part of the performance.</p>

<p>She bowed before the Maharajah, but she
almost forgot to look at him.</p>

<p>Then she looked at Captain Lawrence, but
she almost forgot to bow to him.</p>

<p>The Maharajah looked at Lotus Flower
and he smiled.</p>

<p>Captain Lawrence looked at Lotus Flower
and he did not smile.</p>

<p>He was too much interested in her to remember
to smile.</p>

<p>Just as she was too much interested in
him to remember to bow.</p>

<p>Once more she felt that he was looking
in, in, in&mdash;to her soul.</p>

<p>And once more she felt that her soul was
looking out, out, out&mdash;to him.</p>

<p>“Lotus Flower,” said the Maharajah,
“you must dance your best to-night!”</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” said Lotus Flower.</p>

<p>“To-morrow our guest departs,” said the
Maharajah.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” said Lotus Flower.</p>

<p>“He returns to England&mdash;where he is going
to be married,” said the Maharajah.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>
<p>Lotus Flower stood and stared.</p>

<p>Her heart stopped beating.</p>

<p>She gasped for breath.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lord,” said Lotus Flower.</p>

<p>She had known that the English officer
was departing the next day.</p>

<p>But she had not known that he was going
to leave India.</p>

<p>She had not known that he was going
back to England.</p>

<p>And she had not known that he&mdash;was going
to be married.</p>

<p>Somehow, she had imagined, from his
eyes, that he was going to stay in India.</p>

<p>Somehow, she had imagined, from his
eyes, that she was going to see him again.</p>

<p>Somehow, she had imagined, from his
eyes, that he&mdash;and she&mdash;</p>

<p>But now, all her hopes had been shattered.</p>

<p>All her dreams had been dispelled.</p>

<p>There was nothing for her to do&mdash;but to
dance!...</p>

<p>And so she began.</p>

<p>She waved her arms.</p>

<p>Her bracelets jingled.</p>

<p>She stamped her feet.</p>

<p>Her anklets jangled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>
<p>The tom-toms began to throb.</p>

<p>The pipes began to lilt.</p>

<p>And Lotus Flower started to perform the
Dance of the Cobra.</p>

<p>She swayed from side to side.</p>

<p>She darted to and fro.</p>

<p>She floated backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>Slowly at first.</p>

<p>Then faster and faster.</p>

<p>Finally she stopped.</p>

<p>“Is that the end of the Dance of the
Cobra?” asked Captain Lawrence.</p>

<p>“No,” said the Maharajah, “that is only
the beginning.”</p>

<p>Lotus Flower had been nerving herself
for the ordeal.</p>

<p>She had been working herself up for the
performance.</p>

<p>And now it began in earnest.</p>

<p>A strong eunuch stood guard over a big
basket.</p>

<p>Lotus Flower stooped down, lifted the
cover, thrust in her arms, and drew out a
large cobra.</p>

<p>The cobra wriggled and writhed in her
clutch.</p>

<p>The tom-toms started again.</p>

<p>And the pipes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>
<p>At first, Lotus Flower held the cobra far
from her.</p>

<p>Then a little closer.</p>

<p>And at last, she placed it upon her body.</p>

<p>As she danced around, the cobra twined
about her.</p>

<p>It crawled in and out among the soft folds
of her gauzy drapery.</p>

<p>It disarranged the coverings of her shoulders.</p>

<p>And of her breast.</p>

<p>And of her waist.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Lotus Flower postured
and posed before the Maharajah and his
guest, her naked body gleaming under the
light of the lamps, and the great cruel cobra
crawling over her lithe young limbs.</p>

<p>The cobra twined about her shoulders.</p>

<p>Lotus Flower darted here and there.</p>

<p>The cobra twisted about her thighs.</p>

<p>Lotus Flower rushed hither and thither.</p>

<p>She seemed fairly to fly.</p>

<p>The notes of the music accompanied her.</p>

<p>And then, suddenly, the music ceased, and
two big eunuchs sprang forward to tear the
cobra from her body.</p>

<p>That was part of the performance.</p>

<p>The climax had come.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>
<p>But&mdash;what was this?</p>

<p>Had the dancer gone mad?</p>

<p>Lotus Flower fought off the eunuchs.</p>

<p>She clung to the cobra.</p>

<p>It pressed tightly about her waist.</p>

<p>But Lotus Flower pressed it tighter still.</p>

<p>The eunuchs fought with her.</p>

<p>But Lotus Flower fought against them.</p>

<p>The Maharajah sprang up from his chair.</p>

<p>And Captain Lawrence sprang up from
his.</p>

<p>They rushed towards the unfortunate
dancer, to assist the eunuchs in attempting
to save her.</p>

<p>But it was too late.</p>

<p>Lotus Flower lay on the ground.</p>

<p>The cobra was coiled about her in a grip
of steel.</p>

<p>A grip of steel that would crush the life
out of any human being.</p>

<p>Lotus Flower, the favorite dancing girl
of the Maharajah, was dead....</p>

are!”</p>

<p>She put her feet up on the sofa, so that
she was reclining at full length beside him.</p>

<p>He moved his chair away.</p>

<p>“Don’t go further!” said Mrs. Perry,
“but come nearer!”</p>

<p>He came nearer.</p>

<p>“That’s a good boy!” said Mrs. Perry, “a
very good boy!”</p>

<p>He looked shy.</p>

<p>She looked sly.</p>

<p>“Do you object to my smoking?” said Mrs.
Perry.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>He opened his case.</p>

<p>She took a cigarette.</p>

<p>He lighted it for her.</p>

<p>“Since you have been obliging enough to
let me have a cigarette,” said Mrs. Perry,
“I will be obliging enough to let you have
a&mdash;kiss!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>
<p>He looked amazed.</p>

<p>She looked amused.</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>She held up her face.</p>

<p>He kissed her&mdash;on the mouth....</p>

<p>“And now we are friends!” said Mrs.
Perry, “but we must be more intimate
friends yet. We must know one another
better. Much better. Very much better.
Mustn’t we?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>She put out her hand and touched him
on the knee.</p>

<p>He shrank away from her.</p>

<p>She blew a puff of smoke into his face.</p>

<p>“You must tell me all about yourself,”
said Mrs. Perry.</p>

<p>And he did&mdash;under her clever manipulation.</p>

<p>“And I must tell you all about myself,”
said Mrs. Perry.</p>

<p>But she did not&mdash;again under her clever
manipulation.</p>

<p>When Gordon got up to go, the clock was
chiming twelve o’clock at night.</p>

<p>And when Gordon finally did go, the clock
was chiming three o’clock in the morning.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>
<p>They had been together for six hours....</p>

<p>Mrs. Perry asked Gordon to come again.</p>

<p>He said that he would.</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<p>The next night.</p>

<p>And the next.</p>

<p>And the next.</p>

<p>And after that, he came every night&mdash;for
two weeks.</p>

<p>He didn’t go anywhere else.</p>

<p>He didn’t want to go anywhere else.</p>

<p>First, Gordon and Mrs. Perry left the
pink drawing-room for the yellow sitting-room.</p>

<p>And then, they left the yellow sitting-room
for the lavender boudoir.</p>

<p>It was in the lavender boudoir one evening,
at the end of the two weeks, while they
were smoking perfumed cigarettes, and sipping
absinthe, Mrs. Perry made a strange
and startling statement.</p>

<p>“Gordon,” said Mrs. Perry, “you must
never come to see me again!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“I mean that you are a boy with a future,”
said Mrs. Perry, “and I am a woman
with a past.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, don’t talk like that!” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“But I must talk like that!” said Mrs.
Perry, “you have a life before you, I have
a life behind me. We are not equally
matched.”</p>

<p>“We are!” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“It isn’t fair,” said Mrs. Perry.</p>

<p>“It is!” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“We can’t be friends,” said Mrs. Perry.</p>

<p>“We can,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;we can’t,” said Mrs. Perry, “and
we&mdash;sha’n’t!”</p>

<p>“But why&mdash;why?” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“Because you are a dear sweet boy,” said
Mrs. Perry, “and because I&mdash;I have got a
painted face!”</p>

<p>“I love you,” said Gordon.</p>

<p>“I have got a painted face,” repeated Mrs.
Perry.</p>

<p>“I love you,” repeated Gordon.</p>

<p>“Do you love me&mdash;in spite of my painted
face?” whispered Mrs. Perry.</p>

<p>“No, I love you&mdash;on account of it!” whispered
Gordon.</p>

<p>And it was so.</p>

<p>And she knew it.</p>

<p>The surprise was&mdash;that he knew it.</p>

<p>But Gordon had learned a lot&mdash;in two
weeks....</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> the Rajah of Jurma was
twenty-eight years of age, he believed
himself to be happy.</p>

<p>But when the Rajah of Jurma was twenty-nine
years of age, he <i>knew</i> himself to be
happy.</p>

<p>At twenty-eight, the Rajah had a noble
title and a splendid fortune.</p>

<p>But at twenty-nine the Rajah had also&mdash;a
beautiful wife.</p>

<p>So what more could mortal man desire?</p>

<p>The Rajah had been brought up by a wise
father.</p>

<p>He had been taught self-restraint.</p>

<p>And he had become a virtuous man.</p>

<p>The Ranee had been brought up by a
foolish mother.</p>

<p>She had been taught self-indulgence.</p>

<p>And she had become a vicious woman.</p>

<p>The Rajah was kind and considerate.</p>

<p>The Ranee was unkind and inconsiderate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>
<p>But the Ranee had a beautiful face.</p>

<p>And the Rajah had a bountiful fortune.</p>

<p>So when he had sought her hand in marriage,
she had readily consented.</p>

<p>And the Rajah of Jurma deemed himself
blessed.</p>

<p>In the morning she would walk with him.</p>

<p>And he would smile with satisfaction.</p>

<p>In the afternoon she would talk with him.</p>

<p>And he would laugh with happiness.</p>

<p>In the evening she would lie in his arms.</p>

<p>And he would weep with ecstasy.</p>

<p>He provided her with silken robes and
with jeweled ornaments.</p>

<p>And she had a whole retinue of servants
to wait upon her.</p>

<p>She had men to hold umbrellas over her
when she went out.</p>

<p>She had men to sway fans above her when
she stayed in.</p>

<p>And she had women to dress her and to
undress her, and to do her bidding throughout
the day and throughout the night.</p>

<p>These, and more, had the Ranee.</p>

<p>But the Rajah had&mdash;Kara.</p>

<p>And the Ranee was&mdash;jealous.</p>

<p>And something&mdash;else.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>
<p>Kara was the personal attendant of the
Rajah.</p>

<p>He was five years younger than his master.</p>

<p>And five times handsomer.</p>

<p>At least he seemed so&mdash;to the Ranee.</p>

<p>Kara had been in the service of the Rajah
for seven years.</p>

<p>And he was highly thought of.</p>

<p>He had proved himself worthy of the confidence
that had been placed in him.</p>

<p>He had accompanied his master into danger.</p>

<p>He had served him in health.</p>

<p>And he had nursed him in sickness.</p>

<p>So all this meant a great deal to the Rajah.</p>

<p>(The Rajah had been brought up by a
wise father.)</p>

<p>But all this meant nothing whatever to
the Ranee.</p>

<p>(The Ranee had been brought up by a
foolish mother.)</p>

<p>The Rajah always saw in Kara a faithful
servant.</p>

<p>The Ranee only saw in Kara&mdash;a handsome
man....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>
<p>The Rajah had been married for almost a
year.</p>

<p>During that time he had never been separated
from his wife for a single day.</p>

<p>But then he was summoned to the Viceregal
palace, to consult with the Viceroy on
matters connected with the government of
the Province of Jurma.</p>

<p>He was to be gone for six days.</p>

<p>And so he was sad.</p>

<p>He held his wife in his arms.</p>

<p>She lay there limp.</p>

<p>He kissed her on the mouth.</p>

<p>She felt no thrill.</p>

<p>He tore himself away.</p>

<p>She heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The Rajah left the palace with tears in
his eyes.</p>

<p>The Ranee went to her apartments with
smiles on her lips.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night the Ranee sent for Kara, the
personal attendant of her husband.</p>

<p>“Why did you not go with your master?”
said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“It was not the wish of my lord,” said
Kara.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>
<p>“And what <i>was</i> the wish of your lord?”
said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“That I should remain with my lady,” said
Kara.</p>

<p>“And what were you to do for me?” said
the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I was to guard you,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Guard me&mdash;from what?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“From&mdash;danger,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“The only danger that I fear is&mdash;loneliness!”
said the Ranee.</p>

<p>The Ranee looked in Kara’s eyes.</p>

<p>Kara looked on the ground.</p>

<p>“It was at my wish that your master bade
you stay,” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Did you know that?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“No, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say now that you <i>do</i>
know it?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I thank you, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“You thank me&mdash;for what?” said the
Ranee.</p>

<p>“For your trust, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“I do not call it&mdash;trust,” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>Kara was silent.</p>

<p>“I call it&mdash;esteem,” said the Ranee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>Still Kara was silent.</p>

<p>“I admire you,” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>Why did he not speak to her?</p>

<p>“And I&mdash;shall be&mdash;lonely!” said the
Ranee.</p>

<p>Why did he not look at her?</p>

<p>“Is there anything that I can do for my
lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>His voice was the voice of a servant.</p>

<p>“No, not to-night!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>Her voice was the voice of the mistress....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next night the Ranee sent for Kara
a second time.</p>

<p>“How long have you been with your master?”
said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Seven years, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“You have been in his personal service
throughout that time?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“And you have also been in his confidence?”
said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Then be in mine also,” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>Kara looked surprised.</p>

<p>“And let me be in yours,” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>Kara looked bewildered.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>
<p>“Your master has had adventures?” said
the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Many, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Adventures with men?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Yes, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“And adventures with&mdash;women?” said the
Ranee.</p>

<p>“No, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Oh, he must have!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I do not know, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Try to recollect!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I cannot, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“You refuse to tell me?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to tell, my lady,” said
Kara.</p>

<p>“Nothing to tell&mdash;after seven years!” said
the Ranee.</p>

<p>“My duty has been to serve him,” said
Kara.</p>

<p>“And your duty is now to amuse me!”
said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“So am I!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Is there anything more, my lady?” said
Kara.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;you may go!” said the Ranee....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>
<p>The next night the Ranee sent for Kara
a third time.</p>

<p>Kara stood at the door.</p>

<p>“Come here!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>Kara came into the room.</p>

<p>“Here before me!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>Kara approached her.</p>

<p>“Here beside me!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>Kara hesitated.</p>

<p>The Ranee sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>She flung herself upon his breast.</p>

<p>She curled her arms around his neck.</p>

<p>She kissed him on the mouth.</p>

<p>“I love you!” whispered the Ranee.</p>

<p>He resisted her.</p>

<p>He repulsed her.</p>

<p>He pushed her away from him.</p>

<p>“My lady!” cried Kara. “I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You&mdash;what?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;must&mdash;go!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Why?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I am a servant,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“I have forgotten that!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“But I have not!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I am the servant of the Rajah&mdash;your
husband!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“What of that?” said the Ranee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>
<p>“I serve&mdash;<i>him</i>!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“And not&mdash;me?” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I serve&mdash;<i>him</i>!” repeated Kara.</p>

<p>“You must serve me too!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“In what way, my lady?” said Kara.</p>

<p>“You must&mdash;love me!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;cannot!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;must!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;will not!” said Kara.</p>

<p>She flung her arms around him again.</p>

<p>And again he pushed her away from him.</p>

<p>“He will never know!” whispered the
Ranee.</p>

<p>“I cannot stay!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“I will give you money!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I must go!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Do you know what you are doing?” said
the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I know, my lady!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“And do you know what <i>I</i> can do?” said
the Ranee.</p>

<p>“I know that too, my lady!” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Very well, then!” said the Ranee; “you
need not wait! You may go! But you
shall go&mdash;to the dungeon!”</p>

<p>He stood silent.</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>“Do you hear?” said the Ranee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>
<p>“I hear, my lady,” said Kara.</p>

<p>“Which do you choose,” said the Ranee;
“the dungeon, and chains, or gold, and
<i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“I am the Rajah’s servant,” said Kara,
“but it is for the Ranee to put me in chains,&mdash;if
she sees fit to do so!”</p>

<p>“And by heaven, I <i>do</i> see fit to do so!”
said the Ranee.</p>

<p>She struck a gong.</p>

<p>A servant entered.</p>

<p>“Call the guard!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>The servant clapped his hands.</p>

<p>Two guardsmen appeared.</p>

<p>“This man has made an attack upon
me!” said the Ranee. “Put him in chains,
and throw him into the dungeon&mdash;until the
Rajah returns!”</p>

<p>The guard seized upon Kara, and led
him out of the apartment of the Ranee.</p>

<p>And the Ranee, left to the women who
came hurrying to her assistance, gave way
to a fit of rage.</p>

<p>“The dog, the dog, the dog!” cried the
Ranee.</p>

<p>And, in her fury, she tore her veil to
shreds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>
<p>This veil was, in the East, the symbol of
modesty....</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three days later, the Rajah of Jurma returned
to his palace.</p>

<p>He went at once to the apartment of the
Ranee.</p>

<p>And the Ranee at once informed him of
the attack made upon her by Kara, his servant.</p>

<p>“It seems incredible!” cried the Rajah.</p>

<p>“But it is true!” cried the Ranee.</p>

<p>“What did he do?” said the Rajah.</p>

<p>“As soon as you went away,” said the
Ranee, “in fact, the very first night you
were gone, he came to me and said that you
had left him to guard me, and that he meant
to guard me from&mdash;loneliness! I dismissed
him. The next night he came a second time,
and wanted to tell me of your adventures&mdash;with
women! I dismissed him again. And
then the next night he came a third time,
and sprang upon me, and seized me in his
arms, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>“He must be mad!” cried the Rajah.</p>

<p>“Not at all!” cried the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” said the Rajah.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>
<p>“He is in the dungeon!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“What shall we do with him?” said the
Rajah.</p>

<p>“He must be punished!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Of course!” said the Rajah.</p>

<p>“He should be whipped!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the Rajah.</p>

<p>“And at once!” said the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Without delay!” said the Rajah.</p>

<p>“Have him brought here!” said the
Ranee.</p>

<p>The Rajah gave the order to a servant
and in a short time Kara was brought into
the room, loaded with chains, and guarded
by six men.</p>

<p>Kara stood before the Rajah and the
Ranee.</p>

<p>His face was wan.</p>

<p>His hair was wild.</p>

<p>But his eyes&mdash;</p>

<p>His eyes were like the eyes of a faithful
dog that has tried to lick the hand of its
master, and has been rewarded with a kick.</p>

<p>Kara did not look at the Ranee.</p>

<p>He only looked at the Rajah.</p>

<p>“Kara, what thing is this that I hear&mdash;”
began the Rajah.</p>

<p>“Let him be whipped!” said the Ranee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>
<p>“Kara, what demon possessed you that
you should&mdash;” began the Rajah.</p>

<p>“Let him be whipped!” cried the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Kara&mdash;after all these years&mdash;” began
the Rajah.</p>

<p>“Shall I or shall I not be avenged?” cried
the Ranee.</p>

<p>“Let him be whipped!” said the Rajah.</p>

<p>A strong man stepped forward.</p>

<p>He bore a thick whip.</p>

<p>And he lashed Kara across the back,
again, and again, and again.</p>

<p>Kara stood there, and never made a move,
and never uttered a sound.</p>

<p>“You are not hurting him!” cried the
Ranee. “You are not trying to hurt him!
He does not feel it! Give <i>me</i> the whip!
Let <i>me</i> punish him.”</p>

<p>The Ranee sprang up from her couch,
and seizing the whip from the hands of the
servant, herself began to brutally lash the
body of the unfortunate Kara.</p>

<p>The flesh was ripped and torn.</p>

<p>The blood streamed down his limbs.</p>

<p>But still he made no move.</p>

<p>And still he made no sound.</p>

<p>The Ranee stopped.</p>

<p>She turned to the Rajah.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>
<p>“Here, <i>you</i> must whip him!” cried the
Ranee. “It does not hurt him coming from
me! But it <i>may</i> hurt him coming from
you!”</p>

<p>“But I&mdash;” began the Rajah.</p>

<p>“I must be avenged!” cried the Ranee,
“and <i>you</i> must avenge me!”</p>

<p>The Rajah took the bloodstained whip
from the hands of the Ranee.</p>

<p>He raised it aloft.</p>

<p>But Kara fell to the ground before the
blow was struck.</p>

<p>He had fainted.</p>

<p>Betty was not only a temperamental actress&mdash;she
was also an artistic stage manager.</p>

<p>She had a wonderful eye for situations
and effects.</p>

<p>She always saw that the scenes were
properly set.</p>

<p>And she loved art for art’s sake.</p>

<p>But to-day she wished that she had an
audience to view the performance&mdash;or, at
any rate, that she had a few dramatic critics
present.</p>

<p>It was matinee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>
<p>The hour was four o’clock.</p>

<p>Curtains were drawn over the windows.</p>

<p>Candles were lighted in brackets.</p>

<p>Incense was burning in braziers.</p>

<p>And Betty wore her Eastern robes.</p>

<p>She was draped in yellow silk.</p>

<p>She was decked in golden ornaments.</p>

<p>And she was possessed of the spirit of
adoration....</p>

<p>She sang to Buddha.</p>

<p>A song of praise.</p>

<p>Her voice was sweet.</p>

<p>She danced for Buddha.</p>

<p>A dance of joy.</p>

<p>Her steps were light.</p>

<p>She prayed for Buddha.</p>

<p>A prayer of peace.</p>

<p>Her eyes were sad.</p>

<p>“O Buddha!” cried Betty, “I would
learn of thee! Teach me thy will!”</p>

<p>She stood before him.</p>

<p>But Buddha made no sign.</p>

<p>“O Buddha!” cried Betty, “I do not
ask for much&mdash;only for a little!”</p>

<p>She knelt before him.</p>

<p>Still Buddha made no sign.</p>

<p>“O Buddha!” cried Betty. “I would be
at peace! At peace with the world!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>
<p>She prostrated herself before him.</p>

<p>And still Buddha made no sign.</p>

<p>Betty waited.</p>

<p>And waited.</p>

<p>And waited....</p>

<p>All of a sudden there was a sound.</p>

<p>Betty started.</p>

<p>What could it be?</p>

<p>The sound was repeated.</p>

<p>It was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>Betty heaved a sigh.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet.</p>

<p>“Come in!” said Betty.</p>

<p>A servant entered the room.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Mr. Billy is here,” said the servant.</p>

<p>“Show him in!” said Betty.</p>

<p>Her face was a study.</p>

<p>The servant left the room.</p>

<p>Betty went to a glass.</p>

<p>She inspected herself.</p>

<p>She was satisfied with the reflection.</p>

<p>She had cause to be.</p>

<p>A man entered the room.</p>

<p>This was “Mr. Billy.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Betty!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Hello, Billy!” said Betty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>
<p>“Am I disturbing you?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Not at all!” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Would you rather I went away?” said
Billy.</p>

<p>“On the contrary!” said Betty.</p>

<p>She curled herself on her divan under a
canopy.</p>

<p>He perched himself on a stool beside her.</p>

<p>She rattled her bracelets.</p>

<p>He stroked his chin.</p>

<p>“You look very charming,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“I feel very happy,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“May I ask what you have been doing?”
said Billy.</p>

<p>“You may,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“And will you tell me?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“I will,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“I have been worshipping Buddha!” said
Betty.</p>

<p>“Not really?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes really!” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Do you believe in him?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Of course!” said Betty.</p>

<p>“I don’t!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“You don’t believe in anything,” said
Betty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I do,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you believe in?” said
Betty.</p>

<p>“I believe in&mdash;you!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Be serious!” said Betty.</p>

<p>“I am!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“But Buddha is a god,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“And you are a goddess,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“But he answers my prayers,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“And you answer mine,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Do I?” said Betty.</p>

<p>“I hope so!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“What do you pray for?” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell you?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“I’ve asked you to,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“I pray for love!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Betty.</p>

<p>“For your love,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Betty.</p>

<p>“Do you answer my prayer?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;don’t&mdash;know!” said Betty.</p>

<p>He leaned towards her.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms.</p>

<p>And he breathed his prayer&mdash;with a kiss.</p>

<p>She shrank from him.</p>

<p>She hid her face.</p>

<p>And then she answered his prayer&mdash;and
his kiss....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>
<p>Her head, with its glittering ornaments,
rested on his shoulder.</p>

<p>Her arms, with their jingling bangles,
twined around his neck.</p>

<p>And her mouth, with its maddening caress,
clung to his.</p>

<p>The candles cast a soft glow over them.</p>

<p>The incense sent a sweet odor around
them.</p>

<p>And Buddha kept a watchful eye upon
them....</p>

<p>Billy was about to kiss her again.</p>

<p>But Betty released herself from his embrace.</p>

<p>She got up.</p>

<p>She walked over to the shrine.</p>

<p>And she turned Buddha around&mdash;so that
he could not see.</p>

<p>Then she went back to Billy&mdash;and answered
his prayer, and his kiss&mdash;all over
again....</p>

tired of Bob.</p>

<p>And Bert.</p>

was tired of Buddha, too.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Pepper</span> went to Paris.</p>

<p>She went alone.</p>

<p>And so she was&mdash;lonely.</p>

<p>Why had she ever left New York?</p>

<p>Why had she ever wanted to leave New
York?</p>

<p>Why had she ever wanted to leave New
York&mdash;alone?</p>

<p>Tom had offered to go with her.</p>

<p>And so had Dick.</p>

<p>And so had Harry.</p>

<p>But she had wanted to be alone.</p>

<p>And she got what she wanted.</p>

<p>And a great deal more.</p>

<p>Good Lord!</p>

<p>What a place!</p>

<p>What a disgusting place!</p>

<p>Nothing to see!</p>

<p>Nowhere to go!</p>

<p>Nothing to do!</p>

<p>Who thought that Paris was gay?</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper didn’t!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>
<p>She thought that it was miserable.</p>

<p>Who thought that French women were
stylish?</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper didn’t!</p>

<p>She thought that they were frumps!</p>

<p>Who thought that French men were polite?</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper didn’t!</p>

<p>She thought that they were boors!</p>

<p>So she wrote to Tom, in New York.</p>

<p>And to Dick, in New York.</p>

<p>And to Harry, in New York.</p>

<p>And she said, “I hate Paris!”</p>

<p>In the morning, she walked&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Mile after mile.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, she drove&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Hour after hour.</p>

<p>In the evening, she dined&mdash;alone.</p>

<p>Course after course.</p>

<p>But what was the good of anything?</p>

<p>Nothing!</p>

<p>She met a Count.</p>

<p>But he was a Frenchman.</p>

<p>And a puppet.</p>

<p>She met a Baron.</p>

<p>But he was a Russian.</p>

<p>And a savage.</p>

<p>Then she met&mdash;a Man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>
<p>He was an American.</p>

<p>And a gentleman.</p>

<p>She met him in the Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p>It was in the morning.</p>

<p>She was walking.</p>

<p>So was he.</p>

<p>She was walking up.</p>

<p>He was walking down.</p>

<p>They met.</p>

<p>He looked at her.</p>

<p>She looked at him.</p>

<p>They passed.</p>

<p>He looked around.</p>

<p>So did she.</p>

<p>She walked on.</p>

<p>He followed her.</p>

<p>She knew when he was behind her.</p>

<p>She knew when he was beside her.</p>

<p>And then he spoke.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” said the Man.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said the Woman.</p>

<p>“Please do not misunderstand me,” said
the Man.</p>

<p>“I will try not to,” said the Woman.</p>

<p>“I am an American,” said the Man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Woman.</p>

<p>“I am here alone,” said the Man.</p>

<p>“Well?” said the Woman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>
<p>“And I am&mdash;lonely,” said the Man.</p>

<p>“What has this to do with me?” said the
Woman.</p>

<p>“That is what I want to know,” said the
Man.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” said the Woman.</p>

<p>“You are an American,” said the Man.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Woman.</p>

<p>“You are here alone,” said the Man.</p>

<p>“I am,” said the Woman.</p>

<p>“And you are&mdash;lonely,” said the Man.</p>

<p>“I am&mdash;not,” said the Woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought you were!” said the Man.</p>

<p>“Well, you have made a mistake!” said
the Woman.</p>

<p>“You <i>have</i> misunderstood me!” said the
Man.</p>

<p>“No,” said the Woman, “<i>you</i> have misunderstood
<i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>She walked away.</p>

<p>He stood still.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That afternoon, when she drove, she saw
the Man and he saw her.</p>

<p>That night, when she dined, she saw the
Man and he saw her.</p>

<p>The next morning, when she walked, she
saw the Man and he saw her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>
<p>And so it went&mdash;morning, noon and
night.</p>

<p>Day after day.</p>

<p>He never spoke.</p>

<p>He never made a sign.</p>

<p>And neither did she.</p>

<p>But he was always&mdash;there.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now he was a Man.</p>

<p>And she was a Woman.</p>

<p>He was an American.</p>

<p>And so was she.</p>

<p>So at last&mdash;one evening, in the foyer of
the hotel, she bowed to him.</p>

<p>He came over to her.</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<p>He took it.</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>She looked into his.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> lonely!” said the Man.</p>

<p>“No,” said the Woman, “not any more!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepper wrote to Tom, in New York.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> was noontime.</p>

<p>Noontime in Bombay.</p>

<p>Nana Lalla fared forth through the
town.</p>

<p>The streets were narrow and winding.</p>

<p>They were lined with shops.</p>

<p>Goldsmiths and silversmiths.</p>

<p>Fruit-shops and sweet-shops.</p>

<p>Merchants and money changers.</p>

<p>Before these booths people stopped and
stared.</p>

<p>Bargained and bartered.</p>

<p>Went in, or went on.</p>

<p>Great throngs tramped up and down.</p>

<p>To and fro.</p>

<p>Shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>Some in flowing robes.</p>

<p>Some in scanty rags.</p>

<p>Dogs trotted at one’s side.</p>

<p>Bullocks pushed at one’s back.</p>

<p>And all the time the sun shone in the sky.</p>

<p>Shone like a ball of fire.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>
<p>It burned the world with its blazing
beams.</p>

<p>Nana Lalla hated the day.</p>

<p>And she loathed the sun.</p>

<p>She did not look to the left.</p>

<p>Nor to the right.</p>

<p>She looked straight before her.</p>

<p>And she went her way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was midnight.</p>

<p>Midnight in Bombay.</p>

<p>Nana Lalla was in her room.</p>

<p>She lay on her couch.</p>

<p>Her eyes were open.</p>

<p>But she was dreaming.</p>

<p>Dreaming of sweet-smelling flowers.</p>

<p>And soft-splashing fountains.</p>

<p>And bright-beaming eyes.</p>

<p>Of such things the poets prated.</p>

<p>Of such things the singers sang.</p>

<p>And Nana Lalla had read the poets’
rhymes.</p>

<p>And Nana Lalla had heard the singers’
melodies.</p>

<p>She delighted in these things.</p>

<p>Delighted in them exceedingly.</p>

<p>She tossed and she turned.</p>

<p>She sighed and she sobbed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>
<p>And then she arose.</p>

<p>She went to the window.</p>

<p>She looked through the lattice.</p>

<p>The moon shone in the sky.</p>

<p>Shone like a pool of silver.</p>

<p>It bathed the world in liquid light.</p>

<p>Nana Lalla loved the night.</p>

<p>And she worshipped the moon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nana Lalla wound a scarf about her
body.</p>

<p>Draped a shawl over her head.</p>

<p>And slipped sandals on her feet.</p>

<p>She stole out of her room.</p>

<p>She slipped out of the house.</p>

<p>And once again she fared forth through
the town.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Never had Nana Lalla known such a
night.</p>

<p>Never had Nana Lalla seen such a moon.</p>

<p>So soft, and so silver.</p>

<p>So gentle, and so gracious.</p>

<p>And yet with all, so&mdash;maddening.</p>

<p>Nana Lalla’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>Nana Lalla’s hands trembled.</p>

<p>And Nana Lalla’s heart beat high.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>
<p>Oh, could she only flee away from the
city!</p>

<p>Could she only flee away to the country!</p>

<p>Could she only flee away&mdash;by the light
of the moon!</p>

<p>Or else&mdash;could only something happen!</p>

<p>Something strange.</p>

<p>Something sweet.</p>

<p>If only&mdash;</p>

<p>Someone stood before her.</p>

<p>Someone spoke to her.</p>

<p>Someone touched her arm.</p>

<p>It was a man.</p>

<p>And yes&mdash;his eyes were sparkling too.</p>

<p>His hands were trembling also.</p>

<p>And his heart was beating as wildly as
was hers.</p>

<p>She could see.</p>

<p>She could tell.</p>

<p>She could feel.</p>

<p>He and she were alone.</p>

<p>Alone at midnight.</p>

<p>And the moon was shining.</p>

<p>How she loved the moon!</p>

<p>And perhaps he loved it too.</p>

<p>Nana Lalla was not afraid.</p>

<p>Instead, she was full of hope.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>
<p>He must <i>love</i> the moon&mdash;even as did
she!</p>

<p>So, when he touched her, she did not
shrink away.</p>

<p>When he took her in his arms, she yielded
herself.</p>

<p>And when he kissed her&mdash;she responded....</p>

<p>The Man always remembered Nana
Lalla.</p>

<p>He had loved her.</p>

<p>And he thought that she had loved him.</p>

<p>But Nana Lalla soon forgot the Man.</p>

<p>She had not loved him.</p>

<p>She had only loved&mdash;the Moon....</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
